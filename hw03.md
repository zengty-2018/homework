1)Method of complements:<br>
In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.<br>

2)Byte:<br>
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.<br>

3）Integer (computer science)<br>
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.<br>

4）Floating point<br>
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen. <br>

Nan:<br>
NaN（Not a Number，非数）是计算机科学中数值数据类型的一类值，表示未定义或不可表示的值。常在浮点数运算中使用。首次引入NaN的是1985年的IEEE 754浮点数标准。<br>

证明题：<br>
1.<br>
  1)二进制的负数等于 X 的X每位求反加1:<br>
     由定义知：N(X)=2^k-X<br>
     即:N(X)=[(2^k-1)-X]+1<br>
     由二进制的定义得:2^k=1000000...(k个0)<br>
     所以2^k-1=1111.....(k个1)<br>
     代入得：N(X)=[11111(k个1)-X]+1<br>
     证毕<br>
  2）361<br>

2.<br>
  1)在计算机中int8_t x=-0x1f中x占1个字节，其储存为补码形式，即   取反后+1<br>
    所以x=0xe1<br>
    而int y=x占4个字节，32位（二进制），即8位（16进制），补全过程用符号位数字补全<br>即y=0xffffffe1<br>
